# SQLjunction-table-demo  
A short SQL script to demo a junction-table.  
  
In this script I create 3 databases (Movie, Actor, Genre), fill them up with a few lines, then connect them through 2 junktion-tables using foreign keys.  
I close the script with a query to see if the script finished properly.
